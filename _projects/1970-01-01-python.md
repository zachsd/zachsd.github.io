  Scripting and automation are part of what I enjoy most, and cant think of a better place to start than with python. I've used python for everything from automating linux and windows adminstration tasks, to building out modules for third-part API's. Aside from being an already awesome language, it's also the foundation of another automation platform that I like to use, <strong>Ansible</strong>.
