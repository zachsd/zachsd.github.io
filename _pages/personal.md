## Hobbies
When I'm not working, I enjoy spending my time doing the the following activities:  
* Photography, mostly astrophotography
* Astronomy, obviously. 
* Building out enterprise grade infrastructure in my home lab, aka the garage. 
* All thing science, it's an obsession really. 
* Chilling with family
